## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Solving threads' concurrent and deadlock problem using mutexes

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

```
Git clone the repository 
```

### Installing


```
$make
$./philo [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
##### 1\. `number_of_philosophers` : N numbers of philosophers(n amount of forks)

##### 2\. `time_to_die` : Philosopher will die under this circumstance(ms)

-  After the simulation started, if the philosopher doesnt eat wihtin `time_to_die`ms after the last meal

##### 3\. `time_to_eat` : The amount of time(ms) it takes for the philosopher to eat

-   while eating, one philosopher needs two forks(its left side and right side)

##### 4\. `time_to_sleep` : The amount of time(ms) it takes for the philosopher to sleep

##### 5\. `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat` (optionable choice)

-   Simulation stops when all the philosophers eat Nth amount of time
-   If this is not given, simulation should only stop when one of the philosopher dies

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "Conditions for it to run"></a>

```
0 < number_of_philosophers < 200 || time_to_die > 60 || time_to_eat > 60 || time_to_sleep > 60
```
### In case if you don't want any philosophers to die
 
 - If the number of philsopher is odd, it should be more than 1 philosopher, time to die should be triple the amount of time to eat, time to sleep.
```
$./philo 3 510 200 200
```
 - If the number of philsopher is even, it should be more than 1 philosopher, time to die should be triple the amount of time to eat, time to sleep.
```
$./philo 4 410 200 200
